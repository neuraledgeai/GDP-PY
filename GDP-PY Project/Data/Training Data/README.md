## 📘 Description

This dataset contains **historical GDP data for India (1961–2024)**, used for training the **GDP-PY forecasting model**.  
Each record represents India's GDP at *current prices (USD)*, along with a **lagged feature (`GDP_L1`)** that stores the GDP value from the previous year.  

This dataset forms the foundation for model training, enabling the projection of GDP growth up to 2029.

## ⚙️ Methodology Overview

- **Source Data:**  
  [World Bank GDP (current US$)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=IN)

- **Processing Steps:**  
  1. Imported World Bank GDP data (CSV).  
  2. Converted `Date` column to datetime format.  
  3. Created a lagged feature `GDP_L1` by shifting the GDP series by one year.  
  4. Dropped missing records after lag creation.  

- **Usage:**  
  This dataset was used to train the **GDP-PY model**, which predicts future GDP based on historical growth patterns and lagged relationships.
