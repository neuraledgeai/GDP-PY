_A macroeconomic outlook with risks and opportunities_

**Table 1: Forecasted Annual GDP Growth (%)**

| Year | Growth Rate |
|------|-------------|
| 2025 | 6.93% |
| 2026 | 6.92% |

This indicates a stable growth for the economy. However, whether sustaining this momentum beyond 2027 is a question. Key challenges include:
- lowering domestic demand (including credit demand),
- pessimistic expectations,
- and the current situation of the Indian economy nearing a liquidity trap[^1] pose setbacks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In short**: India’s economy is set for **high growth in the near term**, but the post-2027 landscape will greatly depend on *reforms and revival*.
