Key challenges include lowering domestic demand (including credit demand), pessimistic expectations, and the current situation of the Indian economy nearing a liquidity trap pose setbacks[^1].

> **In short**: India‚Äôs economy is set for high growth in the near term, but the post-2027 landscape will greatly depend on *reforms and revival*.
