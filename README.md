# Forecasting India's Path to a $5 Trillion Economy

This research paper explores India's economic growth trajectory with a focus on forecasting the timeline for achieving the $5 trillion GDP milestone. It develops a predictive model and an interactive web application (GDP-PY) to visualize and analyze Indiaâ€™s GDP growth trends.

The project leverages historical GDP data, machine learning models, and interactive visualizations to make economic trends accessible and actionable.

# ðŸ“œ Abstract

India's economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience and steady growth, particularly in the wake of transformative events like the 1991 economic reforms and the COVID-19 pandemic. This research employs a linear regression model trained on historical GDP data to estimate when India will achieve a GDP of $5 trillion. The findings highlight that, on average, this milestone is expected to be reached by 2029â€“2030, with robust economic trends underpinning this projection.

The interactive web tool, GDP-PY, complements this research by providing visual insights, downloadable data, and customizable forecasting horizons for researchers, policymakers, and enthusiasts.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. Develop a predictive model to forecast India's GDP for future years.
2. Estimate when India will achieve a GDP of $5 trillion at current prices.
3. Analyze pre- and post-pandemic growth patterns to highlight the economy's resilience.
4. Provide an open-source, user-friendly web application (GDP-PY) to explore GDP trends.
5. Share the methodology transparently to foster collaboration and innovation.

# Disclaimer

The model is trained on data only up to 2023, so predictions may vary due to future uncertainties. As new GDP data becomes available, the model will be retrained,*potentially revising the current conclusion of India achieving a $5 trillion GDP by 2029-2030*, ensuring accuracy with the latest trends.
