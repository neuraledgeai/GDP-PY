## 🚀 India GDP Growth Forecast

_A macroeconomic outlook with risks and opportunities_

- India's GDP to grow **6.93% in 2025**.
- And **6.92% in 2026**.

> [!NOTE]
> Forecasts are based on GDP-PY projections at current USD.

**Table 1: Forecasted Annual GDP Growth (%)**

| Year | Growth Rate |
|------|-------------|
| 2025 | 6.93% |
| 2026 | 6.92% |

This indicates a stable growth for the economy. However, whether sustaining this momentum beyond 2027 is a question. Key challenges include:
- lowering domestic demand (including credit demand),
- pessimistic expectations,
- and the current situation of the Indian economy nearing a liquidity trap pose setbacks[^1].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In short**: India’s economy is set for high growth in the near term, but the post-2027 landscape will greatly depend on *reforms and revival*.

India is expected to touch the most awaited $5 trillion GDP (at current prices) by 2028. This growth is backed by the country's economic resilience to sustain it. 

**Table 2: Forecasted GDP of India (Trillion USD)**

| Year | GDP Forecast (Trillion USD) |
|------|------------------------------|
| 2025 | 4.18 |
| 2026 | 4.47 |
| 2027 | 4.78 |
| **2028** | **5.11 ⭐️** |
| 2029 | 5.47 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In short**: The $5 trillion mark is within reach, but the *quality of growth* — inclusive, sustainable, and reform-driven — will define India’s long-term trajectory.
