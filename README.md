## ⛅️ GDP Growth Forecast

**Table 1: Overview of Forecasted Annual GDP Growth (%)**

| Country | 2025 Forecast | 2026 Forecast |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| India   | 6.93%         | 6.92%         |

India's GDP to grow **6.93% in 2025** and **6.92% in 2026**. This indicates a stable growth for the economy. However, whether sustaining this momentum beyond 2027 is a question. Lowering domestic demand (including credit demand), pessimistic expectations, and the current situation of the Indian economy nearing a liquidity trap pose setbacks[^1].
