**India is expected to touch the most awaited $5 trillion GDP (at current prices) by 2028. This growth is backed by the country's economic resilience to sustain it.** 

The figure given above shows the country‚Äôs historical GDP data in current USD and along with the forecast and the $5 trillion milestone. The shaded portion represents the forecast, and the star ‚≠êÔ∏è on it denotes the milestone. For clarity in forecast values, they are given in the table presented below. 

## üìä Forecast (at current prices)

| Year | GDP Forecast (Trillion USD) |
|------|------------------------------|
| 2025 | 4.18 |
| 2026 | 4.47 |
| 2027 | 4.78 |
| **2028** | **5.11 ‚≠êÔ∏è** |
| 2029 | 5.47 |

Therefore, the growth rate of GDP for 2025 is forecasted at 6.93%, and 6.92% for 2026. This indicates a stable growth for the economy. However, whether sustaining this momentum beyond 2027 is a question, lowering domestic demand (including credit demand), pessimistic behaviour, and the current situation of the Indian economy nearing a liquidity trap[^1] pose setbacks.
